                            full bath, mini kitchen, and living room. The extra
                            high ceilings make the room feel more spacious. The 
                            sofa converts to a bed also. We have a hand made

                            porch/deck to relax on and have a glass of Merlot.

                            guest though we never got the chance to
                            meet. She ensured that everything was going
                            on smoothly. Location is great if you love
                            running or something a bit more quiet. Overall
                            would recommend the place anytime.
